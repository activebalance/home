</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Calculate your income. Take a moment to document and add up your monthly income. Your income may come from a variety of sources including a part-time job, dividends or child support.
</strong></p><p><strong>Calculate your expenses. This next step may seem daunting, but you will want to be honest with yourself as it relates to where your money is going each month. Your money more than likely flows into a variety of buckets including:

</strong></p><p><strong>⦁ Cable
</strong></p><p><strong>⦁ Phone
</strong></p><p><strong>⦁ Electric
</strong></p><p><strong>⦁ Gas

</strong></p><p><strong>⦁ Entertainment
</strong></p><p><strong>Cut the Non-Essentials. Next, you have some hard decisions to make. What do you need to survive and what is it that you can do without for a little while or permanently? Can you get rid of your cable? Maybe do without Hulu or Netflix? Maybe you can make your lunch and take it into work rather than passing through the drive-thru every day?
</strong></p><p><strong>Build an emergency fund. Every financial expert encourages us to ensure we have an emergency fund. A minimum of $1,000 should be in place in case you encounter an unexpected event.
</strong></p><p><strong>Long-term, you should aim to save three to six months of your salary. If these numbers sound daunting, start small. Five dollars per month is better than nothing.</strong></p></div>
